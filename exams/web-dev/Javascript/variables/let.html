    <!-- The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)

Variables declared with let have Block Scope

Variables declared with let must be Declared before use

Variables declared with let cannot be Redeclared in the same scope -->

    <!-- Block Scope
Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript did not have Block Scope.

JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope.

ES6 introduced the two new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

These two keywords provided Block Scope in JavaScript: -->
    <script>
        {
            let x = 2;
        }
        // x can NOT be used here
    </script>

    <!-- Global Scope
Variables declared with the var always have Global Scope.
Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope: -->
    <script>
        {
            var x = 2;
        }
        // x CAN be used here
    </script>

    <!-- Cannot be Redeclared
Variables defined with let can not be redeclared.
You can not accidentally redeclare a variable declared with let. -->
    <script>
        // With let you can not do this:
        let x = "John Doe";

        let x = 0;

        // With var you can do this:
        var x = "John Doe";
        var x = 0;
    </script>
    <!-- Redeclaring Variables
Redeclaring a variable using the var keyword can impose problems.
Redeclaring a variable inside a block will also redeclare the variable outside the block: -->
    <script>
        var x = 10;
        // Here x is 10

        {
            var x = 2;
            // Here x is 2
        }

        // Here x is 2

        //Redeclaring a variable using the let keyword can solve this problem.
        // Redeclaring a variable inside a block will not redeclare the variable outside the block:
        let x = 10;
        // Here x is 10

        {
            let x = 2;
            // Here x is 2
        }

        // Here x is 10
    </script>

    <!-- Let Hoisting
Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time.
Meaning: You can use the variable before it is declared: -->
    <script>
        carName = "Volvo";
        var carName;
    </script>
    <!-- Variables defined with let are also hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.
Meaning: Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError: -->
    <script>
        carName = "Saab";
        let carName = "Volvo";
    </script>

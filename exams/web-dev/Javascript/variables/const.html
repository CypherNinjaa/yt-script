    <!-- When to use JavaScript const?
Always declare a variable with const when you know that the value should not be changed.

Use const when you declare:

A new Array
A new Object
A new Function
A new RegExp -->

    <!-- Constant Objects and Arrays
The keyword const is a little misleading.

It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.

Because of this you can NOT:

Reassign a constant value
Reassign a constant array
Reassign a constant object
But you CAN:

Change the elements of constant array
Change the properties of constant object -->
    <script>
        // You can change the elements of a constant array:
        const cars = ["saab", "volvo", "BMW"];
        cars[0] = "Toyota";
        cars.push = ("audi");
    </script>

    <!--   // But you can NOT reassign the array: -->
    <script>
        const cars = ["lambo", "BMW"];
        cars = ["audi", "volvo"]; //Error
    </script>

    <!-- Constant Objects
You can change the properties of a constant object: -->
    <script>
        // // You can create a const object:
        const car = { type: "flat", model: "500", color: "white" };

        // You can change a property:
        car.color = "Red";

        // you can add a property
        car.owner="vikash"
    </script>

    <!-- But you can NOT reassign the object: -->
     <script>
        const car = { type: "Fiat", model: "500", color: "white" };

            car = { type: "Volvo", model: "EX60", color: "red" }    // ERROR
     </script>
</body>

### Course Description

This course introduces students to the advanced tools and technologies used in modern web development. It covers the design and implementation of interactive, responsive, and data-driven websites using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, AJAX, XML, JSON, PHP and MySQL. The course emphasizes both front-end and back-end development, including real-time data handling and dynamic content generation. Students will gain hands-on experience through lab exercises and a mini project that integrates the full stack of web technologies, enabling them to build complete, professional-grade web applications.

### Course Objective

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1.  **CO1:** Understand the foundational structure of web pages using HTML5 and learn how to design static websites with semantic and interactive elements.
2.  **CO2:** Apply CSS3 and Bootstrap to style and build responsive, mobile-friendly web interfaces using modern layout techniques and design components.
3.  **CO3:** Explore data interchange and asynchronous communication techniques using XML, AJAX, and JSON for building real-time, data-driven web applications.
4.  **CO4:** Design and implement dynamic server-side web applications using PHP and MySQL, including database connectivity, form handling, and user authentication.

### Pre-Requisites

1.  Proficiency in at least one programming language, such as Python, Java, or C++. Understanding of programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and data structures like arrays, lists.
2.  Familiarity with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, including classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### Course Learning Outcomes (CLOS)

After completion of this course, students will be able to:

1.  **CLO1:** Understand the principles of coherent web coding and how to use a digital product.
2.  **CLO2:** Apply the incorporation of valid standards-conformant HTML document involving a variety of element types, implement a variety of presentation effects in HTML and XML documents, including explicit positioning of elements.
3.  **CLO3:** Evaluate the skills and project-based experience needed for entry into web application and development careers
4.  **CLO4:** Create dynamic, full-stack web applications by integrating client-side features with server-side programming in PHP and backend database operations using MySQL.

### Pedagogy for Course Delivery

The session will be taught using blended mode, flipped class and practical based methods. In addition to assigning different programs, the course instructor will spend considerable time in understanding the concept of innovation assign small projects to students in groups for implementing the learned concepts.
